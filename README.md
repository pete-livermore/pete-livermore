### Hi, I'm Pete ðŸ‘‹

I'm a user-focussed full-stack developer building clear, eye-catching, usable applications, looking for my first role as a junior. I used to design and manage digital tools in my previous career, but I realised it's way more fun to build them. I gained some skills (see below) through full-time study and practical experience on a bootcamp with General Assembly, and I'm now looking to consolidate and build on these in a fast-paced and innovative professional setting.
